# SRC stl files

These three files are scaled within the script. 
You can replace them with your own design 

```
base_10mm_6mm.STL
```
The base part is just a pentagon shaped cylinder which handles most of the scaling. 
It is currently 10mm with 6mm being the outer radius of the pentagon. 

```
tip_rad_6mm_inc_hole.STL
``` 
The tip has again a 6mm outer radius with this time a 10mm distance to the center of the hole. 
See the middle image of Figure 2 of the pdf, the hole is at the center of the tip, such that "l" makes sense. 

```
tip_rad_6mm.STL
``` 
In case you rather want to glue it all together.
