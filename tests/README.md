# Test | Example stl files and prints 

These two files are ready to be printed. 

```
contact_tensegrity_leg.STL
```
The first one is contact based, with a 40mm leg input and a hole for assembly

```
floating_tensegrity_leg.STL
``` 
The second one is floating based with a 60mm cord length, resulting in a 103.9mm leg length and of course holes for assembly.
